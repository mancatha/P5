Sentiment Analysis 
 

# Introduction 
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed in written or spoken language, and to categorize the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

The analysis can be applied to various types of text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, news articles, and more. Sentiment analysis algorithms use machine learning and linguistic analysis to identify and extract subjective information from the text.

## Project Description
This project serves as a comprehensive guide for training a personalized Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification model using the transformers library by Hugging Face. The process initiates with the utilization of a pre-trained model, followed by fine-tuning through transfer learning techniques. The project provides detailed steps for working with the Hugging Face transformers library, allowing users to adeptly create and enhance their NLP classification models.
For project, we build a classification model trying to predict if a Twitter sentiment is either positive, negative, or neutral. Hugging Face is an open-source and platform provider of machine learning technologies. You can install their package to access some interesting pre-built models to use them directly or to fine-tune (retrain it on your dataset leveraging the prior knowledge coming with the first training), then host your trained models on the platform, so that you may use them later on other devices and apps.
The Hugging face models are Deep Learning based, so will need a lot of computational GPU power to train them. Please use Colab to do it, or your other GPU cloud provider, or a local machine having NVIDIA GPU.
